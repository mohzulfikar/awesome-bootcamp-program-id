# Contribution Guidelines / Pedoman Kontribusi

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Only Bootcamp conducted in English or Indonesian are allowed to be written
2. No duplicate Bootcamps (Although, you can write the same bootcamp name on different category)
3. Seminars that are conducted regularly could also be counted (Please add `[Seminar]` pretext) 
4. It's good to also write the period and how often the bootcamps are conducted (once a month, once a quarter, yearly, etc.)
5. If possible, you could add emojis to the end of bootcamp name. Guideline for the emojis are,
   - If the bootcamps are free and/or need either selection or administration process use ðŸ“„ emojis
   - If the bootcamps are paid/non-free please use ðŸ’° emojis
     -  One bag (ðŸ’°) states that the bootcamps price between Rp. 1 - Rp. 250.000
     -  Two bags (ðŸ’°ðŸ’°) states that the bootcamps price between Rp. 250.001 - Rp. 2.500.000
     -  Three bags (ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°) states that the bootcamps price more than Rp. 2.500.000
